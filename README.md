**Bridge-MedDevKG** is a coarse-to-fine framework for cross-domain entity linking between FDA-approved medical devices and USPTO patents. It constructs a high-fidelity Knowledge Graph by fusing domain-adaptive ontology, multi-signal candidate generation, and learned reranking to bridge the severe semantic gap between regulatory and technical documents.

**Bridge-MedDevKG** is a coarse-to-fine framework for cross-domain entity linking between FDA-approved medical devices and USPTO patents. It constructs a high-fidelity Knowledge Graph by fusing domain-adaptive ontology, multi-signal candidate generation, and learned reranking to bridge the severe semantic gap between regulatory and technical documents.

This repository contains the **code**, **released datasets**, and **pre-computed results** for the paper:
> **From Regulatory Approvals to Patents: Cross-Domain Linking for Cardiovascular Device Traceability**

**Datasets disclosed in `data/`:** (1) **Gold standard** — 585 expert-verified device–patent pairs (`gold_standard.parquet`). (2) **Evaluation / baseline data** — 434 FDA PMA documents (`baseline_fda_docs.parquet`), 50K patent subset (`baseline_patents.parquet`), gold links for retrieval baselines (`baseline_gold_links.parquet`), 2,672 samples for cross-encoder comparison (`evaluation_dataset.csv`), gold relation IDs (`gold_rel_ids.csv`), and a 500-row sample of Stage 2 candidates (`sample_links_to_process.parquet`). (3) **Reranker training data** — `training_data_5a.parquet`, the labeled dataset used to train the XGBoost reranker in Step 5a. The KG in this work is the set of device–patent links (e.g. V4_WEIGHTED_LINK); the data in `data/` are exported from that graph (via `code/local_export_all.py`, which reads from an existing Neo4j instance). One large file — `links_to_process.parquet` (~4.4GB) — is generated from the full Neo4j KG and omitted due to size constraints. A representative sample (`sample_links_to_process.parquet`, 500 rows) is provided in `data/` for reference; with the full file, Steps 5a–5c in `hpc_run_all.py` train the reranker and produce the refined link set (the validated KG). With the disclosed datasets, Steps 6, 7, 8, 13, 14 reproduce all paper tables.

## Data at a Glance

| Component | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| FDA Cardiovascular PMA Documents | 434 |
| USPTO Patents | 698,191 |

## 🚀 Key Features

* **MedDevOnto:** Domain-adaptive ontology injecting expert-guided weights into UMLS. Anchor terms (stent, catheter, valve, etc.) receive weight 1.0; generic terms receive 0.1–0.3. Improves recall by **+11.3%** over uniform UMLS weighting.
* **Multi-Signal Candidate Generation:** Fuses company affiliation ($S_{company}$), SBERT vector similarity ($S_{vector}$), and ontology-weighted entity overlap ($S_{entity}$), achieving **98.97% gold recall** at candidate generation (579/585 pairs).
* **Learned Noise Reduction:** BGE-M3 cross-encoder + XGBoost classification (9-dimensional features, 5-fold CV F1=0.931), achieving **50.9% incremental noise reduction**.
* **Gold standard:** 585 expert-verified device–patent pairs from litigation filings, SEC filings, and virtual patent marking — the first such evaluation set for this task.

## 🛠️ Architecture

```
Stage 1: MedDevOnto (Domain-Adaptive Ontology)
  ├── Entity extraction: DeepSeek-V3 with schema-constrained prompting
  ├── Quote-then-Verify grounding (98.8% fidelity; 1.2% hallucination rejection)
  └── UMLS mapping: exact match + head-noun fallback (82.9% coverage)

Stage 2: Multi-Signal Candidate Generation
  ├── S_company ∈ {0,20} — 29,758-entity company dictionary (M&A-aware)
  ├── S_vector ∈ [0,65]  — all-mpnet-base-v2 cosine similarity
  └── S_entity           — ontology-weighted overlap (Tier S: exact / Tier A: CUI / Tier B: parent)
      Admission: S(d,p) ≥ 70 OR rescue (Tier-S anchor ≥ 60 OR sim ≥ 0.88)

Stage 3: Learned Noise Reduction (Reranking)
  ├── Cross-Encoder: BGE-M3, 1024-token context
  ├── XGBoost: 9-dim feature vector
  └── Immunity Rules: sim ≥ 0.92 + company match → bypass XGBoost
